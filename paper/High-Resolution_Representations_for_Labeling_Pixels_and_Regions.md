# Summary

* **WHY**
  *  The high-resolution network (HRNet) [91], recently developed for human pose estimation, maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions in parallel and produces strong high-resolution representations by repeatedly conducting fusions across parallel convolutions.
  *  In this paper, authers conduct a further study on highresolution representations by introducing a simple yet effective modification and apply it to a wide range of vision tasks.
  *  This simply modification leads to stronger representations.
